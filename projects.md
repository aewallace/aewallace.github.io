First, the incomplete list of projects (mix of inactive & active projects):
_"lines of code" reflect code at the end of project (or current state), and doesn't account for refactoring, etc_

_larger projects_
*RISK (current)
  *open-source GUI version of classic RISK 'board game'
  *Developed GUI & added functionality for main program, added functionality to GUI for helper app
  *maintain backwards compatibility with previously-implemented AI bots
  *1K + lines of code (currently), in Java
*Computational Chemistry (past)
  *senior design project (spring 2014, group of 5)
  *simulate & model interaction of molecules in a clean environment
  *1K + lines of code, in C & C++
*OpenGL render of a building + surroundings + people (past)
  *represent parts of the Auburn University campus in software
  *create a representation of a person
  *create an environment complete with collision detection & multiple types of lighting
  *implement a basic amount of automation
  *1K to 1.5K lines of code, C++
*Equine competition scoring system (past)
  *Create the framework to support scoring of multiple events in a horse (equine) competition
  *Keep track of winners & losers in each category
  *Keep track of teams (horses, jockeys, & support staff) & their statistics & statuses
  *Allow addition or removal of teams
  *Framework had a uniform API compatible with testing suites we & others create
  *Developed using an agile, test-driven development process
  *1.5K to 3K lines of code for all modules (including tests)
*VANET: vehicle network (past)
  *Simulate movement of autonomous vehicles traveling along a road safely, for a potentially endless test
  *Simulate wireless communication, using a physical wired network (over UDP with custom packet formats)
  *Virtual vehicles designed to interact with one another & handle connecting/disconnecting from one another
  *Output logs/data which can be visualized with gnuplot
  *Initial version represented a free broadcast system (where all vehicles talk to all vehicles)
  *Second version represented a centralized transmission system (select trucks acted as communication hubs for all other trucks) to reduce data transmission & data loss
  *900 to 1.5K lines of code
  
_medium & smaller projects_
*Japanese-to-English dictionary (past)
  *produced for a class, with requirements that it be up to Apple's specification (_never distributed via app store_)
  *support finding a Japanese word, finding alternate spellings, & see English translation
  *utilized custom library of words & definitions implemented using Apple's dictionary-style database
  *between 500 and 1000 lines of code, in Objective C (iOS 6)
*Centipede (current)
  *open-source JavaScript version of classic arcade game
  *currently contributing code to reach feature parity with old game
  *currently < 300 lines of code, JS
*Three-PIP (current)
  *print three 4 inch by 6 inch images to one letter-sized sheet
  *replicates functionality found only in older operating systems to reduce wasted paper
  *<300 lines of code, Python
*Console RPG (current)
  *text-based role playing game, existing entirely in the terminal/console at the moment
  *current status: bug fixes, so limited contribution at the moment
  *planned: create select graphical elements to add to the experience, similar to The Oregon Trail
  
_unlisted projects_
*Dependency planner (past)
  *closed source (unavailable for distribution or extended discussion)
  *implement an algorithm to organize tasks based on dependencies & time
  *support for just under 1 million tasks, in a pre-defined input file
  *implemented in Python with no extra libraries, 300 or so lines of code (as a prototype, not to be finished)


And now for the programming languages (or libraries, or tools) used in those:
*C & C++
  *OpenGL (native Windows implementation)
  *CUDA (v5.5, limited use)
  *Visual Studio 2008/2010/2012/2013
  *clang, gcc, & other compilers
*Python (2.7, 3.4)
  *Pillow/PIL libraries
  *PyUnit libraries
*C#
  *Unity 4.5 (for Android 4.4 development tutorial)
*Objective-C
  *XCode (for iOS 6.0 development)
*Java 1.6, 1.7, 1.8 (SE6, SE7, SE8)
  *JavaFX 2.2, 8
  *Eclipse IDE
  *NetBeans IDE
  *JGrasp IDE
  *Android Studio
  *various text editors
*JavaScript
  *Phaser game engine (for a friend's JS game)
*minimal HTML
*minimal Markdown
*UML diagrams (via Argo-UML)
*source control: Git (for use with GitHub)

Other projects or tools may have made minor appearances or taken minor roles, including minor use of custom databases, networking, and UI implementations.

Thanks for visiting! If you have any questions, let me know.
