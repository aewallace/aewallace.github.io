So I haven't taken the time to create a proper About page. But I will! 
In the meantime, I'll tell you to view my projects page.
[projects](/projects/)

Also, if you need links for social media and such, visit my first post!

Or you can look around the site and see my Twitter link somewhere at the bottom.

Well, I suppose if you must know about me:

* 20-something.
* graduated from Auburn University in Alabama.
* also graduated from Spring Hill College, in Alabama.
* My bachelors degrees came as the result of a dual-degree engineering program.
* Those two degrees took 3 years each if you average out (6 years to become a software engineer!)
* I like games (video), reading (fiction and nonfiction, 
tech news, LGBT news, African American news, world news...reading is cool), podcasts (on culture at large),
music (Japanese & Spanish which I slightly understand, as well as French and Italian...whatever sounds like good music!),
fresh veggies, Macs, Windows, Ubuntus, physical keyboards, Androids, glass touchpads, Sony products,
good headphones, good food, smiles, hugs, and people of all types (but it's cool to see a fellow tall person)
* I have a patch of gray hair on the top of my head which seems to be growing exponentially
* Other gray strands appear whenever they feel like it
* I started college as a math major...and it was fun. I kinda miss it.
* Alabama is indeed my home state, but I want to go back to visit Scotland and Ireland...and maybe England and Wales.
* Lovely people who can show their love for others make me happy. Also, people who respect others.
* Being cryptic is fun, but being direct is more fun.
* I often get things on the first pass, but a few more passes to ensure my understanding is correct don't hurt.
* I hope you have a wonderful day/night/evening/any time of the day. :)
